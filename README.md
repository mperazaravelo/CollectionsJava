A project that I created during class COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming) at Valencia College to apply basic knowledge about collections in Java.
The objective of this program is to demonstrate the use of Collections framework and the
Collection interface. The program prompts the user to enter elements to create a list,
then it performs a variety of operations with it, which include printing the list, sorting it
alphabetically and using a custom sort, shuffling it, and other operations.
The user is going to enter 8 unique words (cannot be duplicate) at the beginning. The entered
words are going to be printed out, along with the total number of entries, the longest entry, and the
shortest one. Then the list is going to be alphabetically sorted and printed out. After that, it is
going to appear sorted by length (from longest to shortest). Next, its elements are going to be
shuffled. After that, the user will be prompted to enter a word to search. If the word exists inside
the list, its position is going to be shown, and if not, there will be a not found text. Next the list
is going to be reversed and rotated, and converted into an array and back into a list again.
